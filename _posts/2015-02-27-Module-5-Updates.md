Here is the
[link](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovX00xOHRaQTgtZkU/edit?usp=drivesdk)
for Thursday's lecture.

They failed to copy completely last night so I recopied them to Google Drive
this morning.  As such, they may still be processing and not immediately
viewable.

I have pushed the first part of lab-2 out to github so you should now have
access to it.  Please start it this weekend and feel free to send me any
questions.  I will attempt to respond to emails ASAP but may not get back to you
until Sunday evening.  The only **new** topic are numpy record arrays.
Everything else taps into information and numpy techniques that you already
know.

Again, please divide the work up evenly.  This is a team assignment and not for
the most experienced programmer to do all of the work.  Remember, I will be
starting code reviews with you and expect that anyone is able to explain any
function.  Much of this numpy/sklearn material will be on the midterm and final.
If you are able to write and explain functions for these labs, you shouldn't
have any problems on the midterm.

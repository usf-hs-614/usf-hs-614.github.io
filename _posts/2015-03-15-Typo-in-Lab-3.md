There is a typo in Lab 3 regarding the ```kfoldCV()``` function.  The definition
should be:

```python
def kfoldCV(X, y, n_folds=3):
    pass
```

If you notice, I forgot the "y" parameter which is used as the test data.  In
general, the shape of X should be ```(num samples, num features)``` and the
shape of y should be ```(num samples, )```.


Also, to avoid any confusion, your ```bootstrap()``` function should be:

```python
def bootstrap(data, n_bootstraps=10):
    pass
```

This is purely a cosmetic change that makes it clear to the user of your
function that they should be passing in any data they would like to use for
bootstrapping, and not necessarily just the features.

Just some announcements that I made last week but wanted to make very explicit:

1. I am in Portland at a conference through Wednesday and accessible via email
2. Class for Tuesday, 4/21, will be a pre-recorded Zoom lecture (should be up by
   Tuesday morning) since my wifi is not great
3. We will have a normal class on Thursday, 4/23

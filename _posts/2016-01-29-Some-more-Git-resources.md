As I mentioned in class, here is the [mini-course]() that Nikhil put together.

In addition, here are some other resources that I've looked at briefly.
Remember, not all resources work for everyone and it's largely a matter of
learning what works for you!

- http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/index
- http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-branches
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches

If you come across any others that you find helpful, please feel free to share
with me and I'll send out to the rest of the class.

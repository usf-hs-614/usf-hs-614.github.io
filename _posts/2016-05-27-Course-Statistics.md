It seems that Canvas cannibalized the entirety of my message except for the stats:

Min: 60%
Max: 102%
Median: 90%
Mean: 87%
Std Dev: 10%

The histogram for the course grades can be found at:

As you can see, the class did very well overall so there will be no curve
applied.

In general, I was fairly lenient in my grading of the final so if you insist on
a regrade, please be aware that I will regrade the entire final with a
fine-toothed comb and you may walk out of the regrade with a lower grade.

While you may feel that it's unfair to lose points on the "small things", the
final exam was created to be similar to a coding test that you may get during an
interview.  If you make simple mistakes, most hiring manages will be thinking,
"If they can't even get something so simple correct I don't really care what
else they can do because I have 5 applicants who can."

Also, the final exam is a summative evaluation, intended to validate your grasp
and understanding of the material.  You may feel that your grade is important
but what should be most important to you is how well you have learned the
material.  My intention has never and will never be to ensure that everyone has
high grades.  My only goal is to ensure that you walk out of my course with the
knowledge and skills necessary to do well at your internships and jobs.  Grades
may be a proxy for this but they are very coarse and can be influenced by a
variety of factors.

I encourage you to look beyond your grade because I have never met a single
hiring manager in the tech industry who cares more about your grades than how
well you perform during the interview.

I had a great summer and look forward to working with you all as peers on future
projects!

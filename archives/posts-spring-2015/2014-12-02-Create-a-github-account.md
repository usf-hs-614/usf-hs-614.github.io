Many of you have taken HS 611 with me where we started to incorporate github
into the workflow.  614 will use github extensively throughout the course.  It
will be the primary mechanism for submitting programming assignments for the
course.

If you do not currently have a github account, please [sign up for one](https://github.com/)

You will also need to signup for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

This will unlock several perks for you, the most important of which is a free
subscription to ScreenHero.  While you are welcome to collaborate using any
tool, ScreenHero is designed around the concept of pair programming.  This will
be very helpful with the labs in 614 because they will be team-based projects
where you will be programming in teams.  ScreenHero allows you to share your
screen and collaborate when writing code.

When you sign up for a github account, please send me your github username and I
will invite you to private repositories used for the course.

Here are some links to help you get started with git.  I *HIGHLY* suggest
reviewing these over the Christmas break because github will be the only method
for submitting your assignments.

* [Good resources for learning git and github](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
* [Misc github training materials](https://training.github.com/kit/)

You will need to be familiar with:

* Creating branches
* Cloning
* Pulling from github
* Pushing to github
* Merging changes from another branch (e.g. merging your partner's changes)
* Submitting pull requests within github

Feel free to send me an email between now and the start of classes if you have
any questions or concerns.

Looking forward to meeting everyone!

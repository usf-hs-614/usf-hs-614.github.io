Here is the
[link](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovcllnc1JST2gxZ3M/edit?usp=drivesdk)
for the Zoom recording for Module 2.  I had some technical issues with
  screensharing initially so please follow along the
  [slides](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovQ0swUXVTVC01QWs/edit?usp=drivesdk) manually.  Partway
  through, I enable the screensharing but then it eventually gets cutoff a bit.

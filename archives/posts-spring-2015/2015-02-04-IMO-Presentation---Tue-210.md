I had originally scheduled this in place of class due to a conflicting technical
rescue training that I needed to attend on Tuesday, Feb 10.  While the training
has been canceled, I thought this was still a good opportunity to connect you
with a company that we're setting up a corporate partnership with - [IMO -
Intelligent Medical Objects](https://www.e-imo.com/).  

Here is a
[link](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovSlZtRENRUm51a00/edit?usp=drivesdk)
to an IMO sales sheet.

While their products are focused more toward material covered in HS 611, this
discussion should help on several levels:

1. Learn about a potential practicum site (especially for those of you with
   biology/healthcare/clinical backgrounds)
2. Discuss real-world examples of informatics, and specifically the material
   that was/will be covered in HS 611

This is an opportunity for you to discuss and ask questions of an established
informatics company and help bridge that gap between theory and practice.

I will be setting this up in the classroom but you are also welcome to join
remotely.

Since we spent a little bit more time on feature extraction and selection and we
will not be covering anything the week of the midterm, I've updated the
syllabus/schedule a little bit.

Items of note:

* Modules 7 and 8 were consolidated so Module 7 now covers both k-means
  clustering **AND** hierarchical clustering in the same module

* Each of the remaining modules (9-13) have been shifted up and are now modules
  8-12

* During the new module 8, we will cover basic Bayesian statistics and the naive
  bayes classifier.  We will not be officially covering bayesian networks and
  dynamic bayesian networks.  If you are interested in bayesian networks, please
  come see me and I can give you some additional reading and independent study
  projects.

* The last two class sessions (5/12 and 5/14) are now scheduled as final prep

I added some clarifications to the [first
assignment](https://github.com/usf-hs-614/writing-assignments/blob/master/TPN_Assignment.md).

Namely, I added the following:

For this assignment, you will be putting together the project plan in whatever
format you see fit.  The key is addressing the concerns of the stakeholders and
create the foundation on which the project will be built.  At a minimum, you
should be addressing the following:

* Five components of Clinical Decision Support Systems
* Three life cycles underlying CDS systems
* Cognitive considerations of CDS
* Organizational and cultural issues and change management
* Ethical, legal, and regulatory issues

While there are many other components, those will be the focus of later
assignments.

This assignment may seem a bit open ended but I am interested in seeing what you
decide to focus on and how you choose to deliver the information.

If you have any questions, please send me an email.

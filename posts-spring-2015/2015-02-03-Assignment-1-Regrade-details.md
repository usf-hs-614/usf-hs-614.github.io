First off, please don't take the initial grade you received personally or as a
sign of impending doom.  There were some key points I was looking for and you
have an opportunity to recoup all of the lost points.  The key learning
objective here is to force you to think about many of the bureaucratic and less
technical aspects of clinical decision support.  As with the TPN implementation,
these become 90% of the effort and are a critical part of realizing the benefit
of decision support tools at the bedside.

Regarding the regrade for assignment 1, please go ahead and add to your existing
assignment.  I believe there is a lot of value to trying and incorporate the
additional sections into your existing plan.  Feel free to reorganize your plan
as you see fit.  However, to make it easier to grade, please highlight all of
your new/additonal information so that it's obvious to me.  Thanks!

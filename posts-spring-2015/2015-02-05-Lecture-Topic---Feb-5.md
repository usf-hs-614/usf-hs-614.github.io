Today's topic will be primarily focused on Github and the Pull Request workflow
that will be used to submit programming assignments/labs.  However, at the
beginning, I'll have a 10-15 minute discussion about Assignment #2 and ideas for
the machine learning portion of the TPN calculator.

To aid in the discussion, consider the following:

Please share your ideas – Your incentive is that if your team mentions it first,
then you get to claim that as your project

When you describe your project, discuss the following:
* Inputs
* Outputs
* Benefit
* Learning algorithm(s) you’re considering

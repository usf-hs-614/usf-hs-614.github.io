There have been a couple questions about the second part of lab 2, namely the
experiments with PCA.  Hopefully, this helps clarifies things a little:

1. You don't need to write an explicit function to do the PCA experiments.  You
   can just code these directly in a python file or in an ipython notebook.  I
   will be manually reviewing this code just to make sure that you are applying
   the PCA correctly.

2. I am asking you to answer a couple questions for each subset of the data.
   These answers can be recorded in a text file that you add to the repository.
   Feel free to use markdown within your file.  If you do, please name it with a
   .md extension

3. You can do the experiments on any of the data_\*.csv files.  Since they were
   randomly created, your results should be similar as you move from one file to
   the next.

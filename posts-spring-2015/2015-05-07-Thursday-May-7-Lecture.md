Here is the [link to the
slides](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovOFZNX19waWxhX0k/edit?usp=drivesdk)
for the missed lecture today.  I added some slides intended for reading and then
subsequently did a narrated recording of the slides which can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/a/usfca.edu/file/d/0B-5GjaosMAovSnIzUlhDdDNNNHM/edit?usp=drivesdk).  Please let me know if you have any problems with the video link.  As of this posting, the video is still being converted by Google.

At the end of the video, I discuss a bit my plan for next week to help you
review for the final.  On Tuesday, I plan on giving you a mock final with a
similar problem and set of deliverables.  You will have about 1.25 hours to
complete this mock final whereas you will have 2 hours for the actual final.
As you take the mock final on Tuesday, please pay attention to areas in which
you are experiencing any difficulties.  I highly recommend that you keep a
separate document or notepad ready to write down any areas you would like
further review.

Please send me a list of the items you would like to cover and I will do my best
to cover any and all requests on Thursday.  If you feel like you need additional
help with anything, please shoot me an email to schedule some additional office
hours.

I am open to other ideas but feel like this would be a great way for you to
prepare for the final, include the github-based submission of your code.

As always, please feel free to send me an email should you have any questions or
concerns.

Thanks!

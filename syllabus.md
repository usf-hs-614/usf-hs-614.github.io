### Course Format / Structure###
This will be an extremely fast-paced class since there is **A LOT** of material
to cover.  The general structure for each module is:

1. Review all material prior to Tuesday's class and start project 
2. Tuesdays will be an interactive discussion and should give you all of the
   necessary "theory" to complete the assignment
3. Thursdays will be a structured office hours to help you with the week's
   project
4. Projects are due on Sunday

This course consists of 2 class meetings each week.  Tuesday's meeting will be a
"lecture" though it will be more of an interactive discussion.  I expect that
you will have done any required readings prior to the Tuesday meeting so that we
can have an engaging discussion.  Thursdays will be more of a structured office
hours where I will offer specific technical guidance for the week's project.
To maximize your benefit, it is expected that you have started the project
prior to Thursday's meeting.  Projects will be due the following Sunday.

Here is the schedule for the semester (which may be updated as the course
progresses):

Since lectures take place on Tues/Thurs from 435pm-550pm, some of you will not
be able to attend.  Barring any technical issues, I will be simulcasting the
lectures via Zoom and also recording them.  Tuesdays will primarily be a
"lecture" and Thursdays will be more of a structured office hours.

For those who will be attending primarily by recording, I have additional
office hours on Tuesdays from 630pm to 830pm.  I will treat 630pm-730pm as
traditional office hours and 730pm-830pm as an alternate, condensed lecture for
those who are unable to attend earlier in the day.

### Prerequisite ###
HS 608, or programming experience in Python

### Course Description ###
This course provides students with an introduction to the foundations of
clinical decision support and the application of analytics within healthcare.
The course begins with a high level survey of clinical decision support and many
of the organizational, cultural, regulatory, and legal implications of using
analytics in the clinical environment. The course continues with a survey of
statistical and machine learning techniques including both supervised and
unsupervised learning. Supporting topics such as feature extraction and
measuring performance will be woven in througout the course. The course ends
with a quick review of visualization techniques and the importance of effective
communication of the results and output of analytics systems, especially in the
clinical context.

### Course Objectives ###
By the end of the course, students shall be able to:

1. Describe the organizational, cultural, regulator, and legal implications of
   clinicial decision support systems within healthcare
2. Process and normalize healthcare data for analysis
3. Apply various statistical and machine learning algorithms to healthcare data
4. Evaluate the performance of learning algorithms
5. Visualize and communicate the results of applied analytics

### Textbooks ###
- Flach, P. (2012).  Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make
Sense of Data
- Greenes, R. (2nd, 2014).  Clinical Decision Support - The Road to Broad
Adoption.

### Required Readings in Addition to Textbook ###
Announcements will be made via Canvas and email

### Course Changes ###
Please check for announcements via Canvas - these are considered the definitive
source of announcements.  However, the announcement may just be a link to a post
on the [Course Blog](http://usf-hs-614.github.io).  Any announcements made on
Canvas will also be available on the course blog.

I volunteer with a local Search and Rescue team and may be called out by the
Sheriff’s Office at the last minute for SAR operations.  If this conflicts with
a previously scheduled lecture or office hour, I will send out an email advising
of the conflict and canceling the session.  After the operation, I will
coordinate a makeup session as necessary.

### Computer / Software Requirements ###
For information on Canvas, please visit:
http://www.usfca.edu/its/learning/canvas/forstudents/

This course contains several Python programming assignments.  It is assumed that
you know how to configure your system with a functional Python programming
environment.  You are welcome to use any IDE you choose, but you shall use
Python 2.7 (NOT 3.x).

The programming assignments will require that you have a functional internet
connection in order to download the necessary libraries and documentation.  The
final assignment requires that your computer have an active internet connection
since it requires frequent communication with an external, web-based resource.

### Assignments ###
This course contains writing assignments, programming assignments, and
discussions.

All assignments can be found in Canvas and may contain links to external sources
such as Github.

Writing assignments will be submitted through Canvas and processed using
turnitin.com.

Programming assignments will be submitted through Github's Pull Request
mechanism.  If you are not familiar with this, please consult with your
classmates or come see me in office hours.  Assignments will be rigorously and
objectively graded by an autograder.  If your assignment cannot be run by the
autograder, you will receive a zero.  Otherwise, your grade will be determined
by the number of test cases that your code passes.

### Code Reviews ###
Code reviews are very common in software engineering/development.  Prior to
committing and merging any code to their central software repository, companies
will have a different developer review the code.  This usually becomes a dialog
between the original developer(s) and reviewer(s) and is intended to improve the
overall code base.  In other words, if you continue with a career in
informatics, code reviews will become a part of your regular workflow.

Code reviews will be integrated into this course as part of the programming
assignments – each assignment will trigger code reviews for a subset of
students.  Expect that you will experience at least one code review.  This will
give you an opportunity to discuss any design and implementation decisions, and
to explore possible alternative implementations.  As you have experienced in
previous programming courses, there are oftentimes many different ways to solve
the same problem.  Code reviews are a great way to be exposed to different
approaches that you may not have considered.

Though unfortunate, cheating is also fairly common in courses with programming
assignments.  While code reviews are a great educational tool in general, they
also serve as protection for those students who put in the time and effort to
complete their assignments.  

If your code appears to be similar to that of other students or online sources,
a code review will automatically be triggered.  However, a code review does not
imply that you are being suspected of cheating.

### Midterm and Final ###
There will be a midterm between modules 8 and 9 and a final exam at the end of
the course.  Both of these will require that you physically take the exam in
person, on campus.  If you are unable to, please come see me in office hours so
that we can discuss alternatives.

### Learning Outcomes ###
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Define clinical decision support
2. Understand the cultural, legal, and other implications of clinical decision
   support
3. Explain the difference between clinical decision support and analytics in
   healthcare
4. Develop a basic vocabulary around supervised and unsupervised learning
5. Develop a working understanding of unsupervised learning algorithms and be
   able to integrate existing algorithms into analytics projects
6. Develop a working understanding of supervised learning algorithms and be able
   to integrate existing algorithms into analytics projects
7. Identify and mitigate issues around evaluating supervised learning algorthms
8. Identify and mitigate issues around evaluating unsupervised learning algorthms
9. Discuss the role of visualization in clinical decision support and analytics

These learning outcomes will be assessed through a combination of writing
assignments, programming assignments, discussions, and exams.

The assignments are designed to be exercises for you to develop your knowledge
and also for me to benchmark and gauge your understanding of the material.  If
you approach the assignments as an opportunity to both develop and demonstrate
your knowledge, then I will be able to identify and help fill any gaps.   

Should you choose to take shortcuts and turn in work that is not wholly your
own, you are doing a huge disservice to yourself, and you will struggle in
future courses, and the practicum/Master’s project.  Not only that, you will
also be doing a huge disservice to your fellow classmates and every other
student from this University if you become employed in the field and it turns
out that you are unable to perform the duties for which you were hired.

You are graduate level Master’s students and this is your opportunity to be an
active participant in your own education.  My door is always open and I am happy
to accommodate your schedule and offer as many office hours as you may need.
So, please join me in this opportunity to learn and develop yourself personally
and professionally.  Please DO NOT treat this as just another checkbox so you
can get a piece of paper and show it off to people.

credit available.

### Late / Missed Assignments ###
Late assignments will be accepted but with the following penalty schedule:

Within 24 hours of the due date and time: 1/4 of available points

Within 48 hours of the due date and time: 1/2 of available points

Within 72 hours of the due date adn time: 3/4 of the available points

Assignments will not be accepted past 72 hours of the due date and time.

To avoid any confusion, here is an example:

If the due date is Friday, 2014-08-15 at 23:59:59 Pacific Time, then:

Anything submitted from Saturday, 2014-08-16 at 00:00:00 to 2014-08-16 at
23:59:59 will incur a deduction of 1/4 of available points for the assignment.  

Anything submitted from Sunday, 2014-08-17 at 00:00:00 to 2014-08-17 at 23:59:59
will incur a deduction of 1/2 of the available points for the assignment.  

Anything submitted from Monday, 2014-08-18 at 00:00:00 to 2014-08-18 at 23:59:59
will incur a deduction of 3/4 of the available points for the assignment.  

From 2014-08-19 at 00:00:00 and onwards, the assignment will not receive any
points but you are welcome to submit the assignment for grading and feedback.

**If you have extenuating circumstances, please come see me to discuss (prior to
the assignment deadline.**

### Expected Time Commitment ###
As a graduate level course, you are expected to spend **AT LEAST 12 hours per
week** (and likely more) on this course, split between the course material and
assignments.  Given that this a highly technical course that focuses on the
application of key principles, you may end up spending much more time on
assignments than course lectures.  If you are a part-time student and/or are
taking another highly intensive course, you may consider decreasing your course
load.

### The Learning and Writing Center ###
The Learning &amp; Writing Center provides assistance to students in their academic
pursuits. Services are free to all USF students and include individual and group
tutoring appointments, writing assistance provided by Rhetoric and Composition
professors, and consultations to develop specific study strategies and
approaches. 

The Learning &amp; Writing Center: Cowell Hall, Room 215; 415‐422‐6713;
www.usfca.edu/lwc 

### Students with Disabilities ###
If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think
you may have a disability, please contact USF Student Disability Services (SDS)
at 415 422-2613 within the first week of class, or immediately upon onset of
disability, to speak with a disability specialist.  If you are determined
eligible for reasonable accommodations, please meet with your disability
specialist so they can arrange to have your accommodation letter sent to me, and
we will discuss your needs for this course.  For more information, please visit:
http://www.usfca.edu/sds or call (415) 422-2613.

### Academic Integrity ###
The USF Academic Honor Code can be found at [the following
link](http://www.usfca.edu/uploadedFiles/Destinations/Offices_and_Services/Student_Conduct/Fogcutter/HonorCode_2013.pdf)

While you are encouraged to study in groups and help each other, the work you
submit must be solely yours or your team's.  It is oftentimes tempting to
“borrow” some code from a fellow classmate or an online source during
programming assignments.  It is still considered cheating even if you do not
copy and paste but instead retype the code.  Please do not copy code that was
written down on a napkin, or printed out and handed to you.  Your code will be
processed through cheating detection tools such as Stanford’s MOSS program.
Your writing assignments will be processed through tools such as turnitin.com.

The easiest way to avoid any issues is to NEVER look at another team's code and
to NEVER let another team look at your code.  You can discuss high level ideas
and API documentation but do not share code, ever. 

Any situations where academic dishonesty and/or violations of the Academic Honor
Code are suspected will be referred to the Dean’s office for review.

If you have any questions, or concerns about academic integrity within the
course, please come see me immediately.

### Team-based Assignments ###
For both the writing and programming assignments in this course, you will be
working in teams of 2 (or 3 if there are an odd number of students in the
class).  Please be sure to coordinate with one another and ensure that your
assignments are submittedly properly and promptly.  Since the programming
assignments will be submitted via Github's Pull Request mechanism, it is
**highly** recommended that you also use Github to facilitate collaboration.

If you are unable to participate as part of a team for any reason ASAP, come see
me to discuss.
